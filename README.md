# ChatterBox

A node.js application created with the help of socket.io to provide users with a platform to chat with each other. Users can connect with each other via a common chat room and discuss on their preferred topic. The motivation of this project was to learn how socket.io works. This could be later added as a feature to other application in order to enhance the user experience providing real-time discussion over proposed topics.
